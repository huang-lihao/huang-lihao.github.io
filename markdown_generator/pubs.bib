  abstract = {Lattice metamaterials are widely used in weight-critical applications. The complex internal structures in unit cells make lattice metamaterials achieve unique properties but raise modeling challenges as well. A lot of efforts have been devoted to the homogenization method, but the structural integrity assessment requires local true stress and calls for multi-level modeling with both homogenization and de-homogenization. The present work proposes a novel FE2 multi-level modeling method for lattice metamaterials. The metamaterial is split into four kinds of units by the middle cross-sections. Each external cross-section of a unit is modeled as a reference point of 6 DOFs, i.e., three displacements and three rotations. Those units are modeled as substructures to reduce DOFs to 36 at most and the bounding cube of each unit is considered as an RVE. Instead of the shared displacements and rotations by beams in 3 directions for Taylor's expansion in the 6-DOF continuum, displacements of beam cross-sections in different directions are treated independently. The macroscopic FE element is assumed to be composed of three overlapped sub-elements, of which each node has 6 DOFs. Every sub-element accounts for the beam cross-sections in the corresponding direction. The macroscopic FE model is homogenized from RVEs with the direct interpolation/extrapolation linking two scales, similar to MPCs in the direct FE2 method. The local stress in lattice unit cells is derived from the macroscopic displacement field using stress recovery of substructures following the reverse path of homogenization. The FE2 method is verified by numerical computations of four cubic lattices combined with five loading cases and compared with the substructure model as well as the 3D FE full model for reliability and efficiency in predicting the multi-level modeling of lattice metamaterials.},

  abstract = {Lattice metamaterials are widely used in weight-critical applications and gain more design freedoms with the development of additive manufacturing technology, which requires new accurate homogenization methods to model the mechanical behavior of complex microstructures. In the present work, a new homogenization method based on finite element methods was proposed within the frame of the anisotropic micropolar continuum for the metamaterial, which provided a general approach for both homogeneous and conformal metamaterials of orthogonal lattices. The mapping relation between lattice and finite element mesh as well as edge effects were clarified and modeled. The homogenization approach is verified based on detailed modal analysis and shows high numerical accuracy for engineering applications. Computational experiments confirmed that the micropolar model provides much more accurate results than the classical continuum.},

To overcome this problem, we developed a novel master-slave robotic control system to assist in PCI, and evaluated its safety and feasibility in the delivery and manipulation of coronary guidewires \emph{in vitro} and \emph{in vivo}. {$<$}/p{$><$}p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" id="d758748e222"{$>$} \textbf{Methods:} The novel robotic assist PCI system is composed of three parts: 1) a master actuator, which imitates the traditional torque used by surgeons in conventional PCI, 2) a slave actuator, including a guidewire delivery system and force monitoring equipment, and 3) a local area network based communication system. {$<$}/p{$><$}p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" id="d758748e227"{$>$} \textbf{Results:} The experiment was performed in six pigs. Both robotic and manual control completed the operation with no device- or procedure-associated complications. An experienced interventional cardiologist who was a first-time user of the novel robotic PCI system was able to advance the guidewire into a distal branch of a coronary artery within a similar time to that required with the manual procedure. {$<$}/p{$><$}p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" id="d758748e232"{$>$} \textbf{Conclusion:} This early \emph{in vivo} experiment with the novel robotic assisted PCI control system demonstrated that its feasibility, safety, and procedural effectiveness are comparable to those of manual operation.
